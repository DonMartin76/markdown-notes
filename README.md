# OAuth2 Implicit Flow Demo App

This is a two-part demo app which can be deployed to try out the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow features of wicked.haufe.io.

A bigger how-to guide will follow some time.

## Front end SPA

The front end application is a Single Page Application written in React/Redux with `react-bootstrap`.

[More info here](react-app/README.md).

## Backend API

The API is a plain node.js express application with little fancy stuff. But some concepts are very interesting from an OAuth point of view.

[More info here](api/README.md).
